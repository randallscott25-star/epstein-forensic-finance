## What This Is

This repository contains the methodology, findings, and documentation for a computational forensic analysis of the U.S. Department of Justice's Epstein Files Transparency Act (EFTA) corpus.

I built this project as a solo effort — writing all extraction code, designing the database schema, developing the financial classification pipeline, and performing the forensic analysis myself, with AI assistance for development acceleration and quality assurance. The underlying methodology draws from my professional background in multi-affiliate financial reconciliation, budget variance analysis, and automated exception reporting at institutional scale.

To my knowledge, this represents the first systematic attempt to reconstruct the complete financial infrastructure visible in the EFTA corpus using quantitative forensic methods — moving beyond narrative analysis of individual documents to model the full network of fund flows, entity relationships, and shell trust hierarchies at scale.

### 🔺 New: Offshore Architecture

DOJ subpoena names a BVI shell. ICIJ Offshore Leaks confirms it. Scouting International Investment Co., Ltd. — incorporated Tortola, November 2003, now defunct — sits alongside a $10M+ Butterfly Trust pipeline that paid Maxwell $648K+. 8,526 pages, 172 documents, 3 databases cross-referenced. The offshore map no one had connected.

## Headline Results

> ⚠️ **All findings are navigational tools derived from automated extraction. They have not been independently verified and should not be treated as established fact. See [COMPLIANCE.md](docs/COMPLIANCE.md) for full professional standards disclaimers.**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Financial Activity Extracted** | **$1,964,229,742** (Unverified) |
| **FinCEN SAR Benchmark** | $1,878,000,000 |
| **Extraction Coverage** | **104.6%** |
| **Extraction Phases** | 25 |
| **Contamination Bugs Caught & Fixed** | 9 |
| **Wire Transfers in Master Ledger** | 382 (Phase 25 audited) |
| **Shell-to-Shell Transfers Identified** | 45 |
| **Shell Trust Hierarchy Tiers Mapped** | 4 |

### Three-Tier Confidence Framework

| Tier | Amount (Unverified) | % of SAR | What's Included | Duplication Risk |
|------|-------:|----------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Conservative** | $1,843,653,804 | 98.2% | v2-20 amount-unique + Phase 23 date recovery | Zero |
| **Publication** ★ | $1,964,229,742 | 104.6% | Tier 1 + 8 above-cap court-verified wires | Zero — all exhibit-verified |
| **Expanded** | $1,956,153,971 | 104.2% | Tier 2 + PROVEN entity expansion | Minor name overlap risk |

### Why the Total Exceeds 100%

The SAR benchmark ($1.878B) represents only transactions banks flagged as **suspicious**. The EFTA corpus contains the **complete** financial record — including legitimate, non-suspicious transactions such as Sotheby's auction proceeds ($11.2M), Tudor Futures investment returns ($12.8M), Kellerhals law firm settlements ($23M), and Blockchain Capital VC investments ($10.5M). Total financial flows **should** exceed the suspicious subset. Standard forensic accounting: SAR ⊂ Total Financial Activity.

## Financial Methodology: 5-Axis Forensic Scoring

Every financial record is independently scored across five axes:

| Axis | Weight | What It Measures |
|------|:------:|-----------------|
| Context Language | ×3 | Transaction vocabulary (wire, routing, SWIFT) vs. noise (lawsuit, net worth) |
| Amount Specificity | ×1 | $2,473,891.55 scores high; $10,000,000.00 exactly scores low |
| Date Presence | ×1 | Full date > year only > no date |
| Entity Quality | ×2 | 28 known banks, 64 financial actors, 71+ garbage entity exclusions |
| Source Document Type | ×1 | Financial/spreadsheet > email > general document |

**Classification Tiers:**
- **PROVEN** (≥12): Bank statement language, multi-axis confirmation, ctx_txn ≥ 2
- **STRONG** (8-11): Good signals, minor gaps
- **MODERATE** (5-7): Mixed signals
- **WEAK** / **VERY_WEAK** / **REJECT**: Insufficient evidence or known noise

**Validation:** v6.2 spot-check achieved 93% accuracy on top-30 PROVEN transactions (28/30), with 0% balance contamination (down from 47% in v5).

---

## GAP Analysis

### What's Still Missing

| Gap Source | Estimable? | Reason |
|-----------|:----------:|--------|
| **WEAK/VERY_WEAK tier exclusions** | **Yes — $5M-$15M** | $991M excluded as low-confidence; manual review of top entries could recover $5-15M |
| **Sealed/withheld documents** | No | Court-sealed records inaccessible to EFTA; dollar value unknown |
| **Attempted vs. completed transactions** | No | SARs count attempted; I extract completed only; gap is real but unquantifiable |
| **Destroyed pre-retention records** | No | Bank retention policies may have purged records; unquantifiable |
| **Cross-bank SAR duplication** | No (directional) | Same wire triggering SARs at both banks inflates the benchmark — *reduces* the gap |

Only one gap ($5-15M excluded tiers) has a credible dollar estimate. The others are real information gaps with unknown values. I am not going to put specific ranges on things I cannot measure.

## What Makes This Different

**I didn't read the documents. I audited the money.**

Other projects in this space build search engines, write narrative reports, or create browsable archives. All valuable work. This project applies the same methodology I use in professional public-sector financial auditing — multi-affiliate reconciliation, exception reporting, variance analysis, confidence tiering — to computationally reconstruct the financial infrastructure visible in the EFTA corpus.

The question I set out to answer isn't "what do the documents say?" It's: **"Where did the money go, who moved it, and what did the DOJ redact around it?"**

## Why Findings Only — No Source Code or Database

This repository publishes methodology, findings, and summary data. The underlying source code, database, and raw extraction pipeline are not included. This is intentional and consistent with forensic accounting standards:

- **AICPA SSFS No. 1 (Statement on Standards for Forensic Services)** establishes that forensic practitioners maintain control over working papers, proprietary methodologies, and analytical tools. Work product privilege protects the analytical process.
- **AICPA AU-C §230 (Audit Documentation)** provides that audit documentation is the property of the practitioner and should be retained under the practitioner's control. Sufficient documentation is provided for a knowledgeable reviewer to understand the work performed.
- **Chain of custody**: The 6.9GB forensic database represents a consolidated analytical environment. Releasing it in fragments could enable miscontextualization of intermediate results without the full pipeline logic that produced them.
- **Reproducibility through transparency**: The methodology documentation, scoring weights, classification rules, and dedup logic are fully described — enabling independent replication without distributing the tooling itself.
- **Ongoing analysis**: The database and pipeline remain active analytical tools. Premature release could compromise the integrity of forthcoming data narratives and follow-on investigations.

The master wire ledger (420 wires) and entity classification data are published in full in the `data/` directory. These represent the final audited outputs and are sufficient for independent verification of all published findings.

I built this project — every line of extraction code, every database table, every classification rule, every phase of the pipeline — as a solo effort over 200+ hours across 75+ sessions. AI tools (Claude, Anthropic) were used for development acceleration and quality assurance, the same way a solo practitioner might use a calculator or reference library. The analytical judgments, methodology design, and forensic interpretations are mine.

Professional background: multi-affiliate financial reconciliation, budget auditing, automated classification and exception reporting systems, and large-scale fiscal operations for institutional financial data.

## Ethical Standards

- **Victim protection**: No victim names, identifying details, or testimony content is stored, published, or extractable from any output. Victim-adjacent redactions are noted by proximity only.
- **SSFS alignment**: All outputs include frozen Row 1 caveats, (Unverified) column tags, and navigational-tool disclaimers consistent with professional standards.
- **No attribution of guilt**: Financial flows are documented as they appear in DOJ documents. Appearance in this analysis does not imply wrongdoing.
- **Open methodology**: Every extraction rule, scoring weight, and classification threshold is documented and reproducible.

## Disclaimer

This analysis does not constitute an audit, examination, or review performed in accordance with GAAS, GAGAS, or AICPA SSFS No. 1. See **[COMPLIANCE.md](docs/COMPLIANCE.md)** for a detailed discussion of applicable professional standards and how this analysis relates to them.

All financial amounts are (Unverified) automated extractions unless explicitly noted otherwise. Entity classifications are based on OCR text extraction with automated normalization and may contain errors. Shell entity designations are analytical classifications, not legal determinations.
